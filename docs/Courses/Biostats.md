# Biostatistics: Dealing with Data!

## Biology 303 Fall 2022
## MWF 10:30 - 11:30 am, JHS 112
## Dr. Erika Barthelmess

## Description
A fundamental aspect of practicing biology-related science (be it through the lens of ecology, medicine, public health, etc.) is dealing with data. Data analysis requires much more than picking the correct statistical test. Data sets are being generated at an exponential rate and the potential for combining public data sets to ask new scientific questions is immense. In this course, we will learn to use the free, open-source software program R (the industry standard) for cleaning, organizing, and analyzing biological data sets (including data visualization). We will also learn to create reproducible data analysis workflows. In the later part of the semester, students will analyze a data set from an area of biology in which they have particular interest. This course counts as an Advanced Ecology class for the Conservation Biology major and as an elective for a Data Science major or Statistics minor.

## Pre-requisites: Biology 101 and Biology 102 and at least one Biology class at the 200 or above level. 
STAT 113 (Introduction to Statistics) is recommended. Students from outside of Biology who lack the prerequisites may petition Dr. Barthelmess for admission to the course.
