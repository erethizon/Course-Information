Direct-to-consumer genetic testing has risen in popularity for both humans and nonhuman animals. Collecting genome-level information for millions of customers across the globe creates an invaluable data asset that can power new discoveries in genetic ancestry, health, and longevity.

Brett will be talking about how he uses a genomic database of over 2 million dogsâ€” from Embark Veterinary, a canine genomics and biotechnology company-- to learn more about dog relationships and dog ancestry.

Brett Ford was a Biology major and Math minor while a student at St. Lawrence University. He then went on to complete a Master's degree at the University of Britich Columbia where he studied conservation genetics in an endangered population of badgers. He is currently on the science team at Embark Veterinary.
